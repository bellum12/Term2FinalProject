     <p class="OneP"> I have been playing Fortnite since December 2017, about 3 months after release. Initially, I would play the game with friends and just mess around to have fun. Like with everything I do, I decided I needed to be the
     best I could be, or at least better than my friends. So, I began grinding the game, and in January 2019 I even switched from controller to keyboard and mouse.  </p>

     <p class="TwoP"> After playing on keyboard and mouse for about 7 months, in July 2019 I saw a tournament I could play in. This was right around the World Cup, so Epic was just throwing money around.
       The cut-off to win money was top 750, and I placed 728th, earning me $200 USD. In December I competed in another tournament where I could've won money, but I only played 3/4 hours of the tournament(got 72 points, needed 82).
