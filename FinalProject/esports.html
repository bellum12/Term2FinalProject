     <p class="OneP"> Epic Games have had many competitive tournaments, including many LANs as well as online-tournaments. Most tournaments
     have been unique because qualifiers have been open. Epic Games don't care whether or not a player is signed to an organization, and as such there is no Fortnite leauge. Instead
   there are weekly tournaments where players can participate to win money. </p>

    <h2>The Fortnite World Cup</h2>
     <img height="480px" src="wc.jpg" class="TwoI" > </img>
     <p class="TwoP">Fortnite's largest event was the World Cup. There were open qualifiers every weekend from April through June, and the top few people each week qualified to go to New York in July. The winner of the
     Duo tournament was Aqua and Nhyrox - two Europeans. The winner of the solo tournament was Bugha, who won with nearly double the points of second. Over 30 million dollars in prize money was given out during the World Cup.</p>
