      <h2>Overview</h2>
     <img src="builds.gif" class="OneI"> </img>
     <p class="OneP"> Epic Games(creators of Fortnite) have had many competitive tournaments, including many LANs as well as online-tournaments. Most tournaments(other than the early ones)
     have been unique because qualifiers have been open. Epic Games don't care whether or not a player is signed to an organization, and as such there is no Fortnite leauge. Instead
   there are weekly tournaments where players can participate to win money. </p>

    <h2>The Fortnite World Cup</h2>
     <img src="edits1.gif" class="TwoI"> </img>
     <p class="TwoP">Fortnite's largest event was the World Cup. There were open qualifiers every weekend from April through June, and the top few people each week qualified to go to New York in July. The winner of the
     Duo tournament was Aqua and Nhyrox - two Europeans. The winner of the solo tournament was Bugha, who won with nearly double the points of second. Over 30 million dollars in prize money was given out during the World Cup.</p>

    <h2>Gun Play</h2>
     <img src="gun.jpg" class="OneI"> </img>
     <p class="OneP"> Although there is an emphasis on building and editing, the game is still a shooter at its core. The are many types of guns, ranging from snipers to shotguns,
     just like any shooter. The biggest problem with gun play in Fortnite is bloom: shots fired will not always go to the center of the crosshair, rather they can shoot off at a random angle.</p>

    <h2>The META</h2>
<iframe class = "TwoI" width="525" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3XkK7IQIVc?start=16" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p class="TwoP"> The current meta is box-fighting. Box fighting is used predominantly in competitive play because it is defensive and uses less materials(max 1500 materials, 10 materials per build).
    Box fighting is based off of quick plays, and players are only in the open for fractions of a second. </p>
